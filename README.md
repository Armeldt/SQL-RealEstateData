# DATAImmo Project

![alt text](https://github.com/Armeldt/SQL-RealEstateData/blob/main/Ressources/logo.png?raw=true)

In this project, I was responsible for modifying and enhancing a real estate and land transaction database in France. The objective was to collect and analyze market data to help regional agencies better support their clients.

My role involved updating the relational database schema and integrating new data from open sources such as DVF (real estate transaction values), INSEE population data, and geographic information. I refined the database structure to comply with 3NF standards and implemented the solution using MySQL, generating detailed reports based on SQL queries.

Throughout the project, I developed and executed a series of SQL queries to extract and analyze key metrics from the database, addressing the following objectives:

- [x] Total number of apartments sold in the first half of 2020.
- [x] Number of apartment sales by region for the first half of 2020.
- [x] Proportion of apartment sales by the number of rooms.
- [x] List of the 10 departments with the highest price per square meter.
- [x] Average price per square meter of a house in ÃŽle-de-France.
- [x] List of the 10 most expensive apartments with the region and square footage.
- [x] Growth rate of the number of sales between the first and second quarters of 2020.
- [x] Ranking of regions by price per square meter for apartments with more than 4 rooms.
- [x] List of cities with at least 50 sales in the first quarter.
- [x] Percentage difference in price per square meter between a 2-room apartment and a 3-room apartment.
- [x] Average property values for the top 3 cities in departments 6, 13, 33, 59, and 69.
