## Detailed Project Description:
In this project, I was responsible for modifying and analyzing a real estate and land transaction database in France, focusing on providing market insights to assist regional agencies. Using MySQL, I extracted and processed data to highlight key market trends.

### Key Tasks and Objectives:

1. Database Modification:

    - Update the relational database schema to integrate new data from sources like DVF (real estate values) and INSEE (population data).

    - Ensure the database complied with 3NF standards to optimize performance and scalability.

2. SQL Data Analysis:

    - Write SQL queries to extract insights such as the total number of apartments sold, sales by region, price per square meter, and sales growth trends between different time periods.

    - Analyze pricing data and identify outliers or unusual trends in the real estate market.
  
3. Reporting and Presentation:

    - Generate reports based on SQL queries, summarizing the data into meaningful insights for decision-making by regional agencies.

    - Present findings through SQL-generated reports, including a detailed breakdown of sales and pricing trends across various regions.
  
This project helped to streamline data collection and analysis processes for real estate market insights, aiding in more informed decision-making by regional agencies.
