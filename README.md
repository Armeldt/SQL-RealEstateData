In this project, I was responsible for modifying and enhancing a real estate and land transaction database in France. The objective was to collect and analyze market data to help regional agencies better support their clients.

My role involved updating the relational database schema and integrating new data from open sources such as DVF (real estate transaction values), INSEE population data, and geographic information. I refined the database structure to comply with 3NF standards and implemented the solution using MySQL, generating detailed reports based on SQL queries.

Key deliverables included a comprehensive data dictionary, a normalized database schema, and a PDF report containing the SQL queries and results.
